Gnome Module Position Defaults is a simple plugin that does two things: allows you to set the default filters in the module position popup box and adds the handy dropdown list you might remember from 1.5. If you have been frusted trying to find the right module position EVERY time you have to modify a module, this will allow you to set the common filters to show only the types of positions you need. 

##Features

Allows you to set the default filters used in the Joomla module position selector box. It sounds confusing, but it is not.
Adds the dropdown box of used module position names for quickly adding them without opening and finding a module name.
Joomla 1.7+
Installation

To install first download the file from here if you have not already. Then log into the administrator and go to the Extensions menu->Install/Uninstall. From this spot you can install the plugin by clicking Browse and locating the file. Then click Upload and Install. It will install the plugin by default as disabled. So you need to go to the Extensions->Plugin Manager area and locate the new plugin called 'System - Module Position Defaults' and click on the title. Here you can edit the default filters to be used. Make sure that you enable the plugin and save the item. The next time you go to the module manager the defaults will be applied.
