The Gnome Interface plugin does some simple things to make managing and editing your Joomla site easier. As new features are added, the plugin is updated, but improvements include a quick dropdown list when setting module positions and a slightly tweaked article edit layout. You are able to toggle various selections to your preferences. If you have ideas or suggestions please let us know and we'll consider adding a tweak, just add a ticket here in github.

##Features

* Tweaks the article edit layout, especially suited for laptops or smaller screens to move the edit box higher on the page.
* Allows you to set the default filters used in the Joomla module position selector box. It sounds confusing, but it is not.
* Adds the dropdown box of used module position names for quickly adding them without opening and finding a module name.
* Joomla 1.7+

##Installation

To install first download the file from here if you have not already. Then log into the administrator and go to the Extensions menu->Install/Uninstall. From this spot you can install the plugin by clicking Browse and locating the file. Then click Upload and Install. It will install the plugin by default as disabled. So you need to go to the Extensions->Plugin Manager area and locate the new plugin called 'System - Module Position Defaults' and click on the title. Here you can edit the default filters to be used. Make sure that you enable the plugin and save the item. The next time you go to the module manager the defaults will be applied.
